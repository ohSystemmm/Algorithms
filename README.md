Insert: Uses recursion to find the correct position in the tree based on the value of the node. Values smaller than the root go to the left, values larger go to the right.

Display: In-order traversal to display the tree in sorted order by recursively visiting the left subtree, printing the root, then visiting the right subtree.

Search: Recursively compares the target value with the current node’s value and narrows down the search to either the left or right subtree.

Remove: Handles different removal cases (leaf, one child, two children). Uses the successor/predecessor to replace the value if the node to be deleted has two children.

Successor/Predecessor: Help find the next/previous node in the tree’s order when a node with two children is being removed.
